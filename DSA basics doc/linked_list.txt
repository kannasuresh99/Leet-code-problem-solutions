Linked List:
    Definition:
        A linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. 
        Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together 
        represent a sequence.
    
    Types:
        1. Singly Linked List
        2. Doubly Linked List
        3. Circularly Single Linked List
        4. Circularly Double Linked List

Why we use linked-lists instead of array?
    1. Elements of linked-lists are independent objects
    2. Unlike array the size of the linked-list is not pre-defined
    3. Insertion and removal of elements are very efficient and less memory consuming in linked-lists.

Down sides of linked-lists:
    1. Random accessing a element is not possible in linked lists, we need to iterate through sequentially to find a element.
