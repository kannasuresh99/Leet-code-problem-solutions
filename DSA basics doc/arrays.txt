        1. Single dimensional arrays
        2. Multi dimensional arrays
        
When to use a array?
    1. To store multiple values of same data type
    2. Random access a element in an array

When to avoid using a array?
    1. To store values of different data-types
    2. Array reserves a specific space in the memory, it sometimes affects the performance of the application.
